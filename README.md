# Embedded Systems Projects
This repository contains a compilation of all the projects that I have created in my Embedded Systems 1 & 2 classes (CE2801 & CE2812). Below I will list the order in which the projects were made.

## Embedded Systems 1 (CE2801)
In Embedded Systems 1, we learned the fundamentals of embedded systems (GPIOs, timers, interrupts, etc.) as well as how to program an embedded system & interact with peripheral components in assembly. We used thumb as the language that we programmed in. Below is a list of all the projects/labs that I made during this class period (in order of creation).
1. Hello World Again
2. Knight Rider Lights
3. Subroutines
4. LCDControl
5. Keypad API
6. Electric Lock Tones
7. Piezo Synth
8. Hex Game

## Embedded Systems 2 (CE2812)
In Embedded Systems 2, we ported over our knowledge of microcontroller components and peripherals from CE2801 but learned in c how to do the equivalence of what we did in assembly. Below is a list of all the projects/labs that I made during this class period (in order of creation).
1. Bubble Sort
2. Knight Rider Lights C
3. LCD Api
4. Console Application
5. Play Songs
6. Play Background Songs
7. Frequency Reader
8. Analog Signal Capture
